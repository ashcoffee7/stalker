# Stalker
Our CS3 Project (Introduction to Software Design @ Caltech). Stalker is a one-player game, where the main character (player) is chased by a gravitationally attracted stalker. The player must avoid randomly generated obstacles and collect enough coins before time runs out. Created using C and POSIX APIs.
